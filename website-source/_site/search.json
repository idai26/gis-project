We can use spatial regression to model the relationship between Frey’s average vote share in 2017, 2021, and 2025 and the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of different census tracts.\nOrdinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is a common method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In OLS regression, we assume that the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. The model takes the form\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x_n + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is the dependent variable, \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) are the independent variables, $_0, _1, , \\(\\beta_n\\) are the coefficients, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term, which is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nIn spatial regression, we account for the spatial autocorrelation of the error term. When there is spatial clustering in the error term (as diagnosed by calculating Moran’s I of the residuals of an OLS regression), we will systematically underestimate the standard errors of regression coefficients. Thus, we need to use a spatial error model to account for the spatial autocorrelation of the error term.\nWhen we are most interested in the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables, we use a spatial error model (SEM). The SEM model takes the form:\n\\[\ny = X\\beta + u\n\\]\n\\[\nu = \\lambda W u + \\epsilon\n\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is the dependent variable, \\(u\\) is the spatial error term, \\(\\lambda\\) is the spatial autoregressive parameter, \\(W\\) is the spatial weight matrix, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the “white noise” error term, which is assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nThe spatial weight matrix \\(W\\) is a matrix of weights for the neighboring units. In our case, we use the Queen contiguity weight matrix, which is a binary matrix that is 1 if the units are neighbors and 0 otherwise, defined by the adjacency of the units’ polygons (including corners touching). In particular, we use the row-standardized Queen contiguity weight matrix that is obtained by dividing each row of the binary Queen contiguity weight matrix by the sum of the row."

First, there is the ecological inference issue, where aggregated demographic and socioeconomic characteristics may not be representative of individual voters in a tract. For instance, if we were to find a high correlation between a tract’s percentage of renters and Frey’s vote share, we cannot conclude that renters are more likely to support Frey directly, only that tracts with more renters are more likely to vote for Frey (a subtle yet important distinction). Second, the population that votes in a mayoral election is not the same as the population living in a tract. For instance, some statistics like racial demographics include children under the age of 18, which are not eligible to vote. Others are not eligible to vote because of their citizenship status. Finally, not every eligible voter in a tract votes in a mayoral election, and in general, older and highly-educated residents tend to be more likely to vote in mayoral elections."

The OLS model underestimates Frey’s vote share in North Minneapolis, Southwest Minneapolis, Downtown Minneapolis, and Cedar-Riverside. It overstimates his share in South Minneapolis, Northeast, and Hiawatha/Longfellow. As a general trend, it appears to underfit by underestimating Frey’s vote share in his core support areas and overfit by overestimating his vote share in his less supportive areas."

    "text": "6 Discussion\nThe Moran’s I test for the residuals of the OLS model provides evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals, which means the OLS model is systemtically underestimating the variance of the regression coefficients. The SEM model is able to account for the spatial correlation of the error terms and provides more accurate estimates of the significance of the regression coefficients.\nComparing the coefficients and their standard errors between the OLS and SEM models, we see that there are fewer significant coefficients in the SEM model. pct_age_18_34 is negatively correlated with Frey’s vote share, while pct_age_65_plus is positively correlated with Frey’s vote share, suggesting that a major cleavage in support for Frey is age. The inclusion of pct_higher_ed also provides evidence that opposition to Frey among young voters is not only driven by students at the University of Minnesota, but also among young adults who are not students. Frey’s support with older voters perhaps explains his success in three consecutive mayoral elections - older voters are, in general, more likely to vote in mayoral elections and are thus a powerful voting bloc.\nThe only significant coefficient in the SEM model is pct_built_post2000, which is positively correlated with Frey’s vote share. One of the most impactful policies adopted under Frey’s tenure has been the Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan, which opened up nearly the entire city to multifamily housing development and created ambitious affordable housing goals. Despite the strong pushback from some residents, it appears that areas that have seen more housing development during Frey’s tenure are more supportive of him. Of course, we cannot determine the causal relationship between housing development and support for Frey. It is possible that areas that have seen more housing development during Frey’s tenure are also the most economically prosperous and thus able to attract new development, giving them good reason to support him. On the other hand, Frey could also be directing resources to areas most supportive to him, reversing the causality.\nFuture research might consider using a spatial lag model to account for the spatial correlation of the dependent variable. Due to the interpolation of election results to census tracts, there is the possibility that spatial diffusion in Frey’s vote share would have been created artificially. As a result, I decided not to include a spatial lag model in this analysis. Using only precinct-level data from a single election might be a possible way deterine if one precicnt’s support for Frey is significantly correlated with the support for Frey in its surrounding precincts, after accounting for the demographic trends in the surrounding precincts."
